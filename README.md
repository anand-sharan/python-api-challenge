# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## Analysis and Conclusion
1. Weather becomes warmer as we approach the equater. From the plot, the northern hemispher seems to be slightly humid.
2. Southern Hemisphere Latitude vs. Max Temp the r-value is: 0.7384551058739902 which is more than 0.5 show that they are somewhat correlated.
3. There is not much relationship between latitude and wind speed.
4. There is not much relationship between latitude and cloudiness.
